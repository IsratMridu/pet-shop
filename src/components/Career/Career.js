                <h2>What is a Veterinarian?</h2>
                <p>A veterinarian is a healthcare professional whose entire education and practice is focused on animals. They diagnose, treat, and research healthcare issues for cats, dogs, snakes, and all other animals. Veterinarians chiefly are found caring for pets, but they might also work with professional working animals such as racehorses, racing dogs, milk cows, cattle, and zoo animals. They must therefore have a vast body of knowledge, though most will have specific training to treat specific species; this is especially true when it comes to working animals and exotic species.

                <p>Veterinarians are primarily known to work in clinics, but many vets are found in less-pubic environments. Vets help protect public health by preventing diseases that might spread from animals to humans, researching animal disease and health, and even ensuring the health of agricultural animals so that humans are protected.</p>

                <h2>What does a veterinarian do?</h2>
                <p>As a Veterinarian, you will spend your days examining, diagnosing, and treating various animals that are covered in the scope of your practice. Your daily appointments might include routine check-up examinations, critical emergency visits, and operations of various sort. For instance, you might regularly schedule operations to spay or neuter dogs and cats. You might also have less routine procedures to perform as well. Sometimes animals eat things they shouldn't, which then require human extraction.

                Though we commonly think of Veterinarians practicing in a stand-alone clinic, you might take your practice into a zoo, horse stables, farms, or diagnostic laboratories. Other vets make a practice in public health and thus spend their days in offices. Yet another option, among many, is to work in research. Researchers could work in a laboratory or even outdoors, collecting data on animal populations.</p>

                <h2>Skills to Acquire:</h2>
                <ul className="fw-bold">Veterinarians need a host of skills. You are sure to acquire skills throughout your education. Here is a brief list of the skills you might need to develop as a vet:
                
                <li className="py-3">
                    <h5>Diagnostic skills</h5>
                    <h6>All vets need to be able to discern what is wrong with an animal, despite the animal's inability to communicate. Further, different species will display their symptoms in different ways, some that are direct and others that require professional discernment.</h6>
                </li>

                <li className="py-3">
                    <h5>Surgical skills</h5>
                    <h6>As a veterinarian, you will need to understand how to sedate and prepare an animal for surgery. You must also be skilled with a scalpel and have a very steady hand as well as a comprehensive knowledge of contemporary surgical technologies and procedures. Lastly, you must also know when a surgery is actually necessary.</h6>
                </li>

                <li className="py-3">
                    <h5>Communication</h5>
                    <h6>You will need to be able to communicate effectively with your staff, patients, and their owners. That is, you must be able to work with animals when they are in a state of extreme stress. You must also be able to communicate very good and bad information to the owners.</h6>
                </li>

                <li className="py-3">
                    <h5>Business skill</h5>
                    <h6>If you open your own clinic, you must be able to market and manage that business. Until you establish a solid office manager, you will also need to conduct employee interviews and manage personnel information.</h6>
                </li>
                </ul>
